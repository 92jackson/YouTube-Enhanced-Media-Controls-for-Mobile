- YouTube has increased its efforts to disable background play for non-Premium users on m.youtube- only working options currently:
  1.) Use the YouTube desktop site (youtube.com, not m.youtube.com).
  2.) Try using the browser in "Floating Window" mode or "Split Screen" mode.
- Scrolling up on the recommended videos area (below the video) causes the native YouTube fullscreen gesture to trigger. For now, try scrolling further down before then scrolling up, this seems to prevent the gesture from being triggered.
- Navbar Links (left of custom navbar), and the text search button (right) are not currently functional on the desktop site. Instead of using the text search button, use the newly added search bar (add via the "Navbar Right Controls Layout" options).
- Video loading on the desktop site seem to be slower than on the mobile site, the cause appears to be how YouTube reacts to ad-blocking, no doubt trying their hardest to circumvent it, again 🙄. Not really an issue with the extension, but just worth noting.
