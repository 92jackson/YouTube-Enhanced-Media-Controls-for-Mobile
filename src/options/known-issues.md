- YouTube has increased its efforts to disable background play for non-Premium users, currently we've been unable to find any workaround, as such, the option for Background Playback will likely be uneffective for the time-being. If you need to use another app while playing YouTube, I recommend trying the browser in "Floating Window" mode or "Split Screen" mode.
- Scrolling up on the recommended videos area (below the video) causes the native YouTube fullscreen gesture to trigger. For now, try scrolling further down before then scrolling up, this seems to prevent the gesture from being triggered.
